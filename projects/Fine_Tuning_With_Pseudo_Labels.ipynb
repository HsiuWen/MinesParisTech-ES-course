    "5. Compare the model's performance before and after fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: At the end you should write a report of adequate size, which will probably mean at least half a page. In the report you should describe how you approached the task. You should describe:\n",

    "- Steps taken to alleviate difficulties\n",
    "- General description of what you did, explain how you understood the task and what you did to solve it in general language, no code.\n",
    "- Potential limitations of your approach, what could be issues, how could this be hard on different data or with slightly different conditions\n",
